# Project Overview

This project is designed to introduce you to the basics of data analysis using Python. I will be utilizing several powerful libraries to load, manipulate, visualize, and analyze datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Whether you're a beginner in data science or looking to brush up on your skills, this project will provide a comprehensive guide to the essentials of data analysis.

# Getting Started
Before diving into the analysis, you'll need to set up your environment. This project uses Python, a popular programming language for data science, along with several libraries that make data analysis smooth and efficient.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Python 3.6 or later is recommended. You can download Python from the official Ibsite: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Installation
1. Clone the Repository: First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git. If you're new to Git, you can follow this guide: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/gbolarhan/Python-MLs 
```

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended): It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for your Python projects. This keeps your dependencies organized and avoids conflicts betIen projects. Here's how you can set up a virtual environment:

* Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux).
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```bash
     python3 -m venv venv 
```

* Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS and Linux:

```bash 
    source venv/bin/activate 
```

On Windows:

```bash 
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Dependencies: With your virtual environment activated, install the required libraries by running:

```bash 
    pip3 install ucimlrepo matplotlib seaborn pandas 

```

This command installs the following libraries:

* ```ucimlrepo```: A library to easily fetch datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
* ```matplotlib``` and ```seaborn```: Libraries for data visualization.
* ```pandas```: A library for data manipulation and analysis.

# Running the Analysis
To start analyzing data, open the Jupyter notebooks. If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, you can learn more about them here: https://jupyter.org/

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser, where you can open and run the provided notebooks.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the project or want to add your own analysis, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
